# bitris-commands

A set of commands using https://github.com/knewjade/bitris.

This repository is still in the alpha version. Therefore, the interface is still unstable.

The current goal is to reimplement some commands from https://github.com/knewjade/solution-finder in Rust.
We plan to integrate some components created in the process.

Eventually, we plan to make documentation and samples available to users.
